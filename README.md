# Assignment-2

Create a binary mask for the region of interest in the image, then apply low-pass
filters (Gaussian and Average filters) and high-pass filters (Laplacian and Prewitt
filters) in MATLAB.
2. Implement both the Floyd-Steinberg and Jarvis-Judice-Ninke dithering algorithms on
the image in either Python or MATLAB, then compare the results obtained from
each method.
3. Explain what a Kuwahara filter is, and apply it to the image using either Python or
MATLAB to demonstrate its effect.
4. Take any image and apply the Fourier Transform to this image and the following
filters:( Python or MATLAB)
(b) Butterworth filters
(c) Gaussian filters
5. Take an image and quantize it to 32 grayscale levels using only the imresize function
in MATLAB, and write the steps you followed in the process
